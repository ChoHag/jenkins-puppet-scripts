# Introduction

This repo contains various scripts that get used throughout our jenkins setup.

# Usage

A recommented way of using these scripts could be to setup a seperate jenkins
job that pull in this repository.

Define each script as a managed script and add the arguments. See the readme or
script itself to find out what arguments are available.
